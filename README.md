// Date Revised: 12/4/2025

// Business Redesign

/* Isaiah Approved 12/4/25

// 12/15/2025: made adjustments to all pages

// Peer Review - Sammer Saqa: Site is incomplete. Home Page image isn't there. About background image not showing. Responsiveness isn't ready. None of backgrounds are not showing. Figma looks good, but I would suggest make a mobile version on figma. Coding looks ok to me, site functions, but needs to look like the mock figmas. Correct these and you are good to go!
